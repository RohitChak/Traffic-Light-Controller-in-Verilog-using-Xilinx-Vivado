# 4-Way Traffic Light Controller using Verilog on Basys 3 FPGA

This project involves designing and implementing a 4-way traffic light controller using Verilog on a Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA board. The design focuses on efficient traffic management through the use of finite state machines (FSMs).

## Tools and Technologies
- **Xilinx Vivado**: For design synthesis and bitstream generation
- **Verilog**: Hardware description language used for RTL model development
- **Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA**: Hardware platform for implementation
- **Xilinx Design Constraint (XDC) file**: For mapping signals and ensuring proper FPGA functionality

## Key Features
- **RTL Model Development**: Created an efficient traffic light controller using finite state machines to manage traffic flow.
- **Synthesis and Bitstream Generation**: Synthesized the design in Xilinx Vivado and generated the bitstream file required for FPGA programming.
- **FPGA Implementation**: Programmed the Basys 3 FPGA board, mapped signals with an XDC file, and validated the design through rigorous hardware testing.
